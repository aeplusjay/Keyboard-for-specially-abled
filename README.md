# ❤️ Adaptive Keyboard: Learning With You, For You

## ✨ Overview

**Adaptive Keyboard** is more than just a keyboard — it’s a companion.  
Designed with love, care, and inclusivity in mind, this intelligent keyboard grows with its user. Whether you're navigating physical challenges or fine-tuning motor coordination, this tool *learns from your mistakes and your preferences* to make typing easier, faster, and more empowering.

As you type, it observes.  
When you miss a key, it remembers.  
The more you use it, the more it adapts — **increasing the size of the most-used keys and the ones often mistyped.**

Because no one should be left behind in a world built on communication.

## 🌱 How It Works

- **Personalized Machine Learning**  
  A lightweight ML model tracks your key presses, mistakes, and corrections over time.

- **Mistake-Driven Growth**  
  Keys that are frequently missed or pressed incorrectly grow in size to become more accessible.

- **Use-Informed Prioritization**  
  Frequently used keys are adjusted for ease of access, increasing typing speed and accuracy.

- **Continuous Adaptation**  
  The keyboard evolves as your typing habits change — it's always learning with you.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Typing is a basic human right in the digital age — a bridge to the world.  
But for many, it's a source of struggle and frustration.  
This project was created to offer a little more **dignity**, **ease**, and **joy** in the process of communication.

If this tool helps even one person express themselves more easily, it’s done its job.
